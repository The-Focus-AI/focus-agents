# Source Evaluation Guide

Extended guidance for evaluating source credibility and reliability.

## The CRAAP Test (Detailed)

### Currency

**Questions:**
- When was the information published or last updated?
- Has the information been revised or updated?
- Is the information current or out-of-date for your topic?
- Are the links functional?

**Topic Considerations:**
- Scientific/medical: Prefer sources < 5 years old
- Technology: Prefer sources < 2 years old
- Historical: Older sources may be primary sources
- Legal/policy: Check for recent updates or changes

### Relevance

**Questions:**
- Does the information relate to your research question?
- Who is the intended audience?
- Is the information at an appropriate level (not too basic or advanced)?
- Have you looked at a variety of sources before selecting this one?

**Assessment:**
- Primary source: Directly addresses topic (high relevance)
- Secondary source: Discusses topic indirectly (medium relevance)
- Tangential: Mentions topic briefly (low relevance)

### Authority

**Questions:**
- Who is the author/publisher/source/sponsor?
- What are the author's credentials or qualifications?
- Is there contact information?
- Does the URL reveal anything about the author or source?

**Authority Indicators:**
- Academic credentials (PhD, research affiliation)
- Professional experience in the field
- Published work in peer-reviewed venues
- Official organizational role
- Domain expertise demonstrated through prior work

**Domain Considerations:**
- `.edu` - Educational institution
- `.gov` - Government source
- `.org` - Organization (varies in reliability)
- `.com` - Commercial (check for bias)

### Accuracy

**Questions:**
- Where does the information come from?
- Is the information supported by evidence?
- Has the information been reviewed or refereed?
- Can you verify the information in another source?
- Does the language or tone seem biased?
- Are there spelling, grammar, or typographical errors?

**Verification Methods:**
1. Cross-reference with 2+ other sources
2. Check cited sources directly
3. Look for original data or primary sources
4. Verify statistics with official sources
5. Check for corrections or retractions

### Purpose

**Questions:**
- What is the purpose of the information? (inform, teach, sell, entertain, persuade)
- Do the authors make their intentions clear?
- Is the information fact, opinion, or propaganda?
- Does the point of view appear objective and impartial?
- Are there political, ideological, cultural, religious, institutional, or personal biases?

**Purpose Types:**
- Informational: Presents facts objectively
- Educational: Teaches concepts or skills
- Commercial: Promotes products or services
- Advocacy: Advances a particular position
- Entertainment: Engages or amuses
- Personal: Shares individual perspective

## Source Type Hierarchy

### Tier 1: Primary Sources (Highest Reliability)

- Official government data
- Direct interviews or statements
- Original documents or records
- First-hand accounts

### Tier 2: Authoritative Secondary Sources

### Tier 3: General Secondary Sources
- Trade publications
- Well-established news websites
- Professional organization content
- Educational institution materials

### Tier 4: Use with Caution

### Tier 5: Avoid as Primary Sources
- Anonymous sources
- Unverified claims
- Clickbait sites
- Known misinformation sources

## Bias Detection

### Types of Bias

**Selection Bias:**
- Cherry-picking data that supports a conclusion
- Ignoring contradicting evidence
- Overrepresenting certain viewpoints

**Confirmation Bias:**
- Only seeking information that confirms existing beliefs
- Dismissing contradicting information

**Commercial Bias:**
- Content influenced by advertising or sponsorship
- Positive reviews of paying clients
- Hidden affiliate relationships

**Political/Ideological Bias:**
- Consistently favoring one political perspective
- Loaded language or framing
- False balance or both-sides-ism

### Bias Indicators

**Language Red Flags:**
- Emotionally charged words
- Absolute statements ("always", "never", "everyone")
- Derogatory terms for opposing views
- Excessive superlatives

**Structural Red Flags:**
- One-sided presentation
- Missing context or counterarguments
- Unattributed claims
- Misleading headlines

## Cross-Referencing Strategy

### The Three-Source Rule

For important claims, verify across three independent sources:

1. **Original source**: Where did this claim originate?
2. **Corroborating source**: Who else reports this independently?
3. **Expert source**: What do subject matter experts say?

### Triangulation

Combine different source types for comprehensive coverage:
- Academic research (rigorous methodology)
- Journalistic reporting (current events, investigations)
- Official data (statistics, policies)
- Expert commentary (interpretation, context)

## Quick Evaluation Checklist
